"Marketplace Language Quest” is an educational game designed to teach players food items in a different language to English.  







## **📜&ensp; Backstory**
In a serene suburban neighbourhood, LinguaVille, a renowned language school led by Professor Amelia, had a dream of making language learning a real-life adventure. Their latest innovation came in the form of Lexi, who was built to turn the challenge of language acquirement into an exciting journey through a foreign supermarket. Lexi will help you the player learn different food items for a shopping list in a foreign language
## **🔧&ensp; Mechanics**
The player will navigate around a supermarket and collect food items. Food items, which can be picked up will be highlighted on the shelf with a blue outline. The player can click on the item to add it to their shopping cart. The player can go back to their shopping cart and remove food items. The  player will be able to walk around the shopping aisle and will have to familiarise themselves with the layout of the supermarket. Food items will only have a material or a picture but will display no text. This is how the player learns as they most pick the food items based on the text in the shopping list.
## **🎯&ensp; Objectives**
The player collects the items on the shopping list. These items will be shown in the foreign language. For example, the player will have to collect pan which is Spanish for bread. When the player thinks they are finished they will go to checkout, and they will be given a score based on whether they got the right shopping list. The score will be a percentage based on what food items in the player’s shopping cart they got right on the shopping list and what food items they got wrong.
## **🎲&ensp; Random Elements**
At the start of the game the player will be given the choice on how many words they would like to learn between 1 and 20 inclusive. If the player picks 10 words they would like to learn, they will be given a  practice round where they can go around the supermarket and see the translation of different food items to English and the foreign language. The player at the start must also pick how many of those 10 elements they would like to be tested on. For example, let’s say they pick 4.  When the player is ready, they can start the level and the player will have to collect 4 random food items from the random 10 food items from their practice level.
## **🖥️&ensp; UI**
Before starting the level, the player will be shown a “Set up your shopping list.” On this screen the player using a slider can choose how many words from 1 to 20 they would like to learn. They will also be given a slider for how many words from the amount they want to learn(in this case 10), they want to be tested on. The player will also be allowed to choose which language they want to learn, Spanish or Portuguese. In the top left corner of the game screen the player will be shown the shopping list they must collect in the text of the foreign language. In the bottom left corner of the screen the player can pull up a screen which shows the food items they have collected. The shopping cart will only the food items through pictures and no text.
